# homebrew-technicalpickles

Homebrew formula for things I use that I couldn't find elsewhere... especially if they aren't versioned (ie main only) üòÅ


## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install technicalpickles/technicalpickles/<formula>`

Or `brew tap technicalpickles/technicalpickles` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
